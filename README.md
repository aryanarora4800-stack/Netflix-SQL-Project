# Netflix-SQL-Project
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's global content library using SQL. As an economics student, I focused on identifying market trends, production longevity across different regions, and catalog health to understand the strategic positioning of the platform.

# Objectives
Market Segmentation: Analyze how Netflix balances its library across different countries.
Content Lifecycle: Identify the gap between content release and its arrival on the platform.
Production Trends: Track the growth of Movies vs. TV Shows over the last decade.
Data Integrity: Perform an audit of the dataset to identify missing metadata that could affect recommendation algorithms.

# Dataset
The data is sourced from Kaggle and contains over 8,000 rows of titles including information on directors, cast, country, release year, and duration.
